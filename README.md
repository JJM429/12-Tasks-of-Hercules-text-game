# 12-Tasks-of-Hercules-text-game
This project is a Java text-based adventure game inspired by the legendary 12 Tasks of Hercules. Players progress through a series of interactive challenges, each designed to test problem-solving, resource management, and strategic decision-making.

I took full ownership of the project lifecycle, from concept design and planning to coding, debugging, and final polish. The game features:

* Object-Oriented Programming principles applied to manage tasks, gameplay logic, and user input.

* A multi-stage progression system with branching paths and increasing complexity.

* Iterative improvements based on testing and feedback to ensure smooth gameplay and user engagement.

This project strengthened my skills in Java, OOP, debugging, and project management, while allowing me to channel creativity into both the narrative design and technical implementation. Delivering a complete, playable game to a high standard reinforced my ability to see ambitious projects through from start to finish.
